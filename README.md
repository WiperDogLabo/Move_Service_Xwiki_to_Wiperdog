Move_Service_Xwiki_to_Wiperdog
==============================
Xwiki is overload by sending, processing, receiving data at MonitoringData page realtime mode.  
So to reduce workload of xwiki, we will try to transfer the workload into Wiperdog.  
Move services from xwiki to wiperdog:
- MonitoringData Page
- processPolicy Page
- DisplayPolicy Page
- LastAccumulation page
